                <p>Every year at least 8 million to 10 million metric tons of hazardous waste are shipped across borders to be disposed of or recycled. This waste is mainly residues from industrial waste disposal operations, waste mineral oils, and lead and/or lead compounds. These hazardous exports are regulated by the Basel Convention, a UN treaty established in 1989 to monitor the transboundary movements of hazardous waste.<br/>As of 2013, 182 of the 195 sovereign states recognized worldwide had ratified the convention. The U.S. is considered among the largest generators of hazardous waste and signed the treaty in 1990 but has never ratified it.</p>
                <p>The Convention recommends that before the end of each calendar year, every member-nation should report on, among other things, the type and amount of hazardous wastes and other wastes they have exported and imported, their destination and origin, and transit countries. But fewer than 50% of the countries have made such reports.</p>
                <p>In 1995, at a meeting of the Conference of the Parties, an amendment - also known as the Ban Amendment - was adopted to stop exports of hazardous waste from the 34 member-nations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), European Union, Liechtenstein and all other states. The amendment is not yet in force because it must be ratified by 10 more parties. In recent years, hazardous waste exports from OECD to non-OECD countries has decreased but are still taking place. In this visualization you could see the exports that would be prohibited if the ban were in force.</p>
